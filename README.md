Machine Learning 2

Case Study 1: Random Forest

Insurance Premium prediction
Develop a Random Forest Regressor model based on several features of individual such as age, physical/family condition and location against their existing medical expense to be used for predicting future medical expenses of individuals that help medical insurance to make decision on charging the premium.

Case Study 2: SVM

Iris species - Classification
We are given a dataset containing information about different types of flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Our task is to build a machine learning classification model using SVC that can predict the type of the flower based on the given features.
